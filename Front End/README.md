# Gis-Tech-Proj
this is the Gis-Tech project repository,

Here will be all the code and dummy code programed in this project, each side : back-end, front-end and Arduino code have their own folder.

Note: stay as much as you can in the main branch, only branch out when your adding / removing something that could break the code,
to prevent a loss of code. also make sure when branch out to merge it with the main tree when ever the test code succeeded.

ofcoure if there are any questions ask me in teams or IRL.
